If you are reporting an issue that involves any JSX (e.g.
<div>{`${example}`}</div>), PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you have properly
setup and are sourcing this plugin https://github.com/mxw/vim-jsx

WE DO NOT support JSX automatically, you need another plugin to add get this
functionality.

Also, if possible, please include a snippet of code that we can easily copy and
paste that replicates your bug.
